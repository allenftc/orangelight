# July 6
I completely rearranged the K230 symbol so that the pins were in locations that made sense.
Before: It is all very messy and ordered by physical location rather than purpose

After: Actually arranged by function of the pins

The RAM has been completed. I mostly followed the example schematic although there were a few things like the VREFs and power connections that I had to figure out.

I added both a 512MB flash chip and an SD card slot so I can make it more compact later but also have the option of an SD card. (There is more RAM than flash ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€).

# July 12
I added the clocks, reset circuit, and the USB connector. The USB connector was a little confusing because I didn't know what the ID and CC pins did but I understand now.
